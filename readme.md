
# Road 141

### Overview
A Sonic-inspired side-scrolling platformer developed as a project for **CMSC 141** at the University of the Philippines - Cebu. This game was implemented using **Kaplay.js**, combining fast-paced arcade gameplay with core concepts from automata theory and formal languages.


### 🚀 Features

- Classic side-scrolling mechanics inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog
- Smooth animations and sprite handling via Kaplay.js
- Implementation of finite automata concepts
- Custom level design with increasing difficulty
- Keyboard controls for intuitive gameplay

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Kaplay.js** – for rendering, animation, and game loop
- **HTML5 Canvas** – for graphics rendering
- **JavaScript** – core game logic
